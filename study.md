## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
Ember uses the URL to supply a search parameter to the model hook, where it will then
basically find the matching hash with the value of the dynamic segment from the URL and
then use that as the starting point to receive the specified data. The model is responsible
for displaying any data, whether it be from an Ember Data record or just a promise.
The route is responsible for accessing the correct model, setting it in the controller,
and then from there, the correct template is called upon to render the data.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URLS switch between view states, history API isn't always supported. For GH
pages deployment, certain features may not be linked to properly.
```
